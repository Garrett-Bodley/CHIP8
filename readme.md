# CHIP-8

I made a CHIP-8 virtual machine in C!

### What is CHIP-8?

> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker made on his 1802 Microprocessor. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. â€” [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)
